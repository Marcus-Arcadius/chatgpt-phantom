## Magic commands ✨✨✨

⚠️ To use magic commands, Turn OFF "Phantom Mode" on the toggle button.

1. **_Continue the article_**

   > This command allows you to resume creating the remaining article according to past conversations. This is useful when ChatGPT stopped running before the completion.

2. **_List the source links with a `[url](url)` format_**

   > This command allows you to generate clickable links from the source links. You don't need to inject url with the actual url. Just copy and paste the command. ChatGPT will handle the rest for you.

3. **_Expand the paragraph of "the subtitle"_**

   > This command allows you to expand the specific paragraph. Replace the subtitle with your original subtitle. Similary you can summarize a paragraph by replaceing the phrase "Expand" with "Summarize". "Rewrite" to get it in other words, "Continue" to get new sentences after the paragraphs. Pretty much anything you want.

4. **_Write the article in HTML_**
   > This command allows you to output the article in HTML.
